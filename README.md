17,000 skin condition images used to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network


For this project I am jumping into a dataset obtained from the site below. It contains 17,000 images of 114 labeled skin conditions, which have been grouped into 9 more broad categories and then 3 even bigger categories. I have the option to classify as finely or broad as I'd like. The data has also been annotated by a multiple people for skin color using the Fitzpatrick Scale.

For the project, I will use the CSV provided to sort the images into a directory of train, test, and validation folders with subfolders for each skin condition coded 0-8. I will then resize and scale the data to fit into my Convolutional Neural Networks. I will build one of my own and optimize it as much as I can. 

After that, I would like to find a pre-built CNN that may work even better. I will use transfer learning to boost my model's effeciency by using pre-trained weights and biases, saving computational time and effort. I will describe my thought process and methods as I go, and will summarize the best model I have produced.
